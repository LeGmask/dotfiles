# .zsh_plugins.txt - antidote plugins file
#

### Overview
#
# The `.zsh_plugins.txt` file is used by antidote to configure Zsh bundles. Bundles are
# just a fancy way of referring to Zsh utilities, frameworks, prompts, or plugins.
# `.zsh_plugins.txt` is used by antidote to generate a static `.zsh_plugins.zsh` file,
# which can then be sourced in your `.zshrc`. You can use this file as a starting point
# for your own config. Strip out instructional comments (ie: lines beginning with a '#')
# and any plugins you don't need, then add what you like and make it yours!
#
# NOTE: Order matters in this file! Some bundles need to be last, and others are
# prerequisites. Read the documentation for the plugins you use to ensure proper
# configuration.
#
###

### Completions
#
# You may want to add some additional completions to Zsh. Completions look in your fpath
# for completion functions, which are functions named with a leading underscore
# (eg: _git). You need to add all supplemental completions to your fpath prior to
# running `compinit` to use completions functionality properly. You will want to find
# a completion plugin that runs `compinit` for you, or you can run it yourself in
# your .zshrc after antidote loads like this:
#
#   autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
#
###

# zsh-users/zsh-completions is a popular plugin for adding supplemental completions.
# We combine the `path:` and `kind:fpath` annotations here:
zsh-users/zsh-completions path:src kind:fpath

# This is the recommended plugin for handling compinit and setting completion zstyles.
# It's designed to handle all the complexity of the Zsh completion system so the user
# doesn't have to.

### Regular Plugins
#
# Plugins are the simplest kind of bundles. You can point to a full git URL, or if you
# assume GitHub.com, then you can use the user/repo shorthand.

### Frameworks
#
# Frameworks are a collection of Zsh features, settings, and plugins meant to ease
# Zsh configuration. Unfortunately, all that power can come with serious drawbacks.
# Frameworks can often set more settings or aliases than you need, cluttering your Zsh
# config and slowing things down. Use with caution!
#
# Frameworks are handled in antidote using the `path:location/of/plugin` annotation.
#
###

### Framework: Oh-My-Zsh
#
# Oh-My-Zsh is a very popular Zsh framework. You might choose to use plugins from OMZ
# in your own config. Depending on which plugins you use, you may also need to include
# OMZ's entire "lib" directory. If you do this, be careful - "lib" configures a lot of
# very broad settings. If you are familiar with what you are doing, you may choose to
# only include parts of "lib".
#
#   # use all of lib
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib
#   # -OR-, only use only the specific files we care about
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/clipboard.zsh

### Deferred Plugins
#
# Antidote allows you to defer loading plugins. This is similar to concepts like "turbo
# mode" in other plugin managers. Antidote handles deferring plugins by leveraging
# romkatv/zsh-defer, which "defers execution of a zsh command until zsh has nothing else
# to do and is waiting for user input". In general, you should not defer plugins unless
# you know for sure they properly support deferred loading, and there are no adverse
# side-effects (see: https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-defer#Caveats). However, for
# certain plugins, this can greatly increase your zsh startup speed.

### Final Plugins
#
# Remember plugin order matters! Put plugins that need run last at the bottom of your
# .zsh_plugins.txt file.
